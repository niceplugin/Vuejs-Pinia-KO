# Type Alias: StoreGeneric

> **StoreGeneric**: [`Store`](Store.md)\<`string`, [`StateTree`](StateTree.md), [`_GettersTree`](GettersTree.md)\<[`StateTree`](StateTree.md)\>, [`_ActionsTree`](ActionsTree.md)\>

Generic and type-unsafe version of Store. Doesn't fail on access with
strings, making it much easier to write generic functions that do not care
about the kind of store that is passed.
